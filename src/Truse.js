    <p><b>Eric Barone</b> is ConcernedApe, the creator <a href="/Stardew_Valley" title="Stardew Valley">Stardew Valley</a>, a pretty good farming simulator game that has said to have succeeded old farming games like the "Harvest moon" series, and have become a loved game in the indie scene of gaming. From 2012 to 2024, he has brought joy to many with his game, in which he created all art, sound effects, and music. The legend himself currently resides in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Seattle">Seattle, Washington</a>.
  </p>
  
  <p>In early 2019, ConcernedApe formed a small development team to continue updating the game. The <a href="/Version_History#1.4" title="Version History">1.4 update</a> of the game was developed by ConcernedApe, Arthur Lee (a.k.a. Mr. Podunkian), and Alex Erlandson (a.k.a. zillix). The <a href="/Version_History#1.5" title="Version History">1.5 update</a> of the game was developed by ConcernedApe and Arthur Lee. See <i><a href="/Stardew_Valley" title="Stardew Valley">Stardew Valley</a></i> for more info about the game's development. A pretty good strategy on Eric's side, as it allows him to work on other projects while simultaneously working on further updating stardew valley.
  </p>
  
  <p>In late 2021 he announced <i>ConcernedApeâ€™s Haunted Chocolatier</i>, a new game still in development. ConcernedApe began work on this game in late 2020 as the sole developer. and the community is excited and waiting patiently for its full release some time in the future.
